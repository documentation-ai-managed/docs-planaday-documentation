## Core Resources

Planaday's API revolves around three primary resources: courses, students, and instructors. Understanding these entities and their relationships is key to effective integration.

<Columns cols={3}>
  <Card title="Courses" icon="book" href="#courses">
    Manage course structures, enrollments, and progress tracking.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Students" icon="users" href="#students">
    Handle student profiles, enrollment records, and performance data.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Instructors" icon="user" href="#instructors">
    Administer instructor information and course assignments.
  </Card>
</Columns>

## API Structure

Our RESTful API follows standard HTTP conventions with predictable URL patterns and JSON responses. All endpoints support common operations.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Courses" icon="book">
    Courses represent educational programs or training sessions. Each course has properties like title, description, duration, and enrollment capacity.

    <CodeGroup tabs="JavaScript,Python">
      ````javascript
const course = {
  id: 'course_123',
  title: 'Advanced JavaScript',
  description: 'Master modern JavaScript techniques',
  duration: 40,
  maxStudents: 25,
  instructorId: 'inst_456',
  startDate: '2024-02-01',
  status: 'active'
};
````
      ````python
course = {
  'id': 'course_123',
  'title': 'Advanced JavaScript',
  'description': 'Master modern JavaScript techniques',
  'duration': 40,
  'max_students': 25,
  'instructor_id': 'inst_456',
  'start_date': '2024-02-01',
  'status': 'active'
}
````
    </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Students" icon="users">
    Students are individuals enrolled in courses. Track their progress, attendance, and contact information.

    <Expandable title="Student Properties" default-open="false">
      - Unique identifier
      - Personal information (name, email, phone)
      - Enrollment history
      - Progress metrics
      - Custom fields for additional data
    </Expandable>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout kind="info">
  All resources include timestamps for creation and last modification to support data synchronization.
</Callout>

## Rate Limiting

Protect system stability with intelligent rate limiting that adapts to usage patterns. Monitor your request patterns to avoid throttling.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Limits" icon="bar-chart">
    Review your current usage in the API dashboard. Standard plans allow 1000 requests per hour.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Implement Backoff" icon="refresh-cw">
    Use exponential backoff when receiving 429 (Too Many Requests) responses.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Optimize Queries" icon="filter">
    Use filtering and pagination to reduce unnecessary requests.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<ExpandableGroup>
  <Expandable title="Rate Limit Headers">
    Check response headers like X-RateLimit-Remaining and X-RateLimit-Reset to monitor your usage.
  </Expandable>
  <Expandable title="Upgrade Options">
    Enterprise plans offer higher limits and dedicated support for high-volume integrations.
  </Expandable>
</ExpandableGroup>

## Pagination

Handle large datasets efficiently with cursor-based pagination. This ensures consistent performance regardless of data size.

<CodeGroup tabs="JavaScript,Python">
  ````javascript
// Example pagination request
const response = await fetch('/api/v1/courses?limit=50&cursor=course_123');
const data = await response.json();
console.log(data.nextCursor); // Use for next page
````
  ````python
# Example pagination request
import requests

response = requests.get('/api/v1/courses', params={'limit': 50, 'cursor': 'course_123'})
data = response.json()
print(data['next_cursor'])  # Use for next page
````
</CodeGroup>

<Callout kind="tip">
  Always use the provided cursor for subsequent requests to ensure consistent ordering and avoid duplicates.
</Callout>

## Error Handling

Implement robust error handling to gracefully manage API failures and provide meaningful feedback to users.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="HTTP Status Codes" icon="alert-circle">
    Standard HTTP status codes indicate success or failure types.

    | Status Code | Meaning |
    |-------------|---------|
    | 200 | Success |
    | 201 | Created |
    | 400 | Bad Request |
    | 401 | Unauthorized |
    | 403 | Forbidden |
    | 404 | Not Found |
    | 429 | Too Many Requests |
    | 500 | Internal Server Error |
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Error Response Format" icon="file-text">
    Consistent error response structure for easy parsing.

    <Expandable title="Error Response Example" default-open="true">
      ```json
      {
        "error": {
          "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
          "message": "The provided email address is invalid",
          "field": "email",
          "details": {
            "expected_format": "user@domain.com"
          }
        }
      }
      ```
    </Expandable>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<ExpandableGroup>
  <Expandable title="Retry Logic">
    Implement exponential backoff for transient errors (5xx status codes) with a maximum retry count.
  </Expandable>
  <Expandable title="Logging Errors">
    Log API errors with context information to aid debugging and support requests.
  </Expandable>
</ExpandableGroup>

## Webhooks

Receive real-time notifications about important events through webhooks. Configure endpoints to automatically process course updates and student activities.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Webhook" icon="webhook">
    Register a webhook endpoint URL in your Planaday account settings.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Events" icon="settings">
    Choose which events trigger notifications (enrollment, completion, etc.).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Handle Payloads" icon="code">
    Process incoming webhook payloads and update your systems accordingly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Signatures" icon="shield">
    Validate webhook signatures to ensure authenticity.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="warning">
  Webhook endpoints must respond with a 200 status code within 10 seconds to avoid retries and potential blocking.
</Callout>

<Expandable title="Supported Events" default-open="false">
  - Student enrollment
  - Course completion
  - Grade updates
  - Attendance changes
  - Instructor assignments
  - System maintenance notifications
