## Authentication Methods

Planaday supports multiple authentication methods to ensure secure access to your course data. Choose the method that best fits your integration needs and security requirements.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="API Keys" icon="key">
    Generate and manage API keys for programmatic access. Each key can be scoped to specific resources and operations.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Generate Key" icon="plus">
        Navigate to Settings > API Keys and click "Generate New Key." Choose permissions and expiration date.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Configure Scopes" icon="settings">
        Select which resources (courses, students, reports) the key can access. Use principle of least privilege.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Secure Storage" icon="lock">
        Store keys securely using environment variables or secret management systems. Never expose keys in code.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="OAuth 2.0" icon="shield">
    Use industry-standard OAuth 2.0 for delegated access. Ideal for third-party integrations and user-specific permissions.

    <CodeGroup tabs="JavaScript,Python">
      ````javascript
const oauthConfig = {
  clientId: 'your_client_id',
  clientSecret: 'your_client_secret',
  redirectUri: 'https://yourapp.com/callback',
  scope: 'read:courses write:students'
};
````
      ````python
oauth_config = {
  'client_id': 'your_client_id',
  'client_secret': 'your_client_secret',
  'redirect_uri': 'https://yourapp.com/callback',
  'scope': 'read:courses write:students'
}
````
    </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout kind="info">
  All authentication methods use HTTPS encryption to protect credentials in transit.

## API Key Management

Properly manage your API keys to maintain security and control access. Regularly rotate keys and monitor usage patterns.

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Key Rotation" icon="refresh-cw" href="#key-rotation">
    Regularly update keys to prevent unauthorized access.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Usage Monitoring" icon="bar-chart" href="#usage-monitoring">
    Track API usage and detect unusual patterns.
  </Card>
</Columns>

### Key Rotation

Implement a key rotation strategy to minimize the impact of compromised credentials. Plan rotations during low-traffic periods.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate New Key" icon="plus">
    Create a new API key with the same permissions as the old one.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update Applications" icon="edit">
    Replace the old key in all your applications and services.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Integration" icon="check-circle">
    Verify that all systems work with the new key.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Delete Old Key" icon="trash-2">
    Remove the old key once you're confident everything is working.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Usage Monitoring

Monitor API key usage to detect anomalies and ensure compliance with usage limits. Set up alerts for suspicious activity.

<Expandable title="Monitoring Features" default-open="false">
  - Real-time usage dashboards
  - Configurable rate limits
  - Automated alerts for high usage
  - Detailed logs with timestamps and IP addresses
  - Export capabilities for auditing
</Expandable>

<ExpandableGroup>
  <Expandable title="Rate Limiting">
    API calls are limited to prevent abuse. Standard limits are 1000 requests per hour per key, with higher limits available for enterprise accounts.
  </Expandable>
  <Expandable title="IP Whitelisting">
    Restrict API access to specific IP addresses or ranges for additional security.
  </Expandable>
</ExpandableGroup>

## OAuth 2.0 Flow

Implement the OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow for secure delegated access. This method is recommended for web applications.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Register Application" icon="settings">
    Register your application in Planaday to obtain client credentials.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Request Authorization" icon="send">
    Redirect users to Planaday's authorization endpoint with required parameters.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Handle Callback" icon="arrow-right">
    Process the authorization code returned to your callback URL.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Exchange for Token" icon="key">
    Exchange the authorization code for an access token.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="tip">
  Use the PKCE extension for additional security when implementing OAuth 2.0 in mobile or single-page applications.
</Callout>

## Security Best Practices

Follow these security practices to protect your Planaday integration and user data.

<Expandable title="Credential Storage" default-open="true">
  - Store API keys and secrets in secure environment variables
  - Use secret management services like AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault
  - Never commit credentials to version control systems
  - Rotate keys regularly, at least every 90 days
</Expandable>

<ExpandableGroup>
  <Expandable title="Error Handling">
    Implement proper error handling to avoid exposing sensitive information. Return generic error messages to users.
  </Expandable>
  <Expandable title="Access Logging">
    Log authentication attempts and API usage for security auditing and compliance purposes.
  </Expandable>
</ExpandableGroup>

<Callout kind="danger">
  Never share API keys or OAuth credentials in public forums, documentation, or unsecured communication channels.
